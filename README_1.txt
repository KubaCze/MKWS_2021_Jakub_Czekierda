#Influence of inlet air speed on combustion temperature and thrust in Cantera with comparison of the usage of two different fuels

The purpose of the project was to evaluate the influence of inlet air speed on combustion
temperature and thrust using Cantera.In addition there was made a comparison between usage of ethane and methane as fuel. During the evaluation a simple model of inlet,
combustion chamber and nozzle were used.
